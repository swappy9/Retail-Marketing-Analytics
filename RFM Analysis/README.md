# RFM Analysis

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing model for behavior based customer segmentation. It groups customers based on their transaction history – how recently, how often and how much did they buy. 
RFM helps divide customers into various categories or clusters to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions and also for future personalization services.

* Recency: It refers to the number of days before the reference date when a customer made the last purchase. Lesser the value of recency, higher is the customer visit to a store.

* Frequency: It is the number of times customer made the purchases from the reference date. Higher the value of Frequency, more is the customer visit to the company.

* Monetary: This refers to the amount of money spent by a customer during a specific period of time. Higher the value, more is the profit generated to the company.
